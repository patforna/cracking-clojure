; 2.4 You have two numbers represented by a linked list, where each node
; contains a sin- gle digit. The digits are stored in reverse order, such that
; the 1â€™s digit is at the head of the list. Write a function that adds the two
; numbers and returns the sum as a linked list.
;
; Example: (3, 1, 5) + (5, 9, 2) => (8, 0, 8)
