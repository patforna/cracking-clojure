; 2.5 Given a circular linked list, implement an algorithm which returns node
; at the beginning of the loop.
;
; DEFINITION
; Circular linked list: A (corrupt) linked list in which a nodeâ€™s next pointer
; points to an earlier node, so as to make a loop in the linked list.
;
; EXAMPLE
; input: A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> C [the same C as earlier]
; output: C
