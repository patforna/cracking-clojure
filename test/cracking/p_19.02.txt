; Design an algorithm to figure out if someone has won in a game of
; tic-tac-toe.

; Here's some clojure pseudo code on how this could be solved:
; Time: O(n)

(loop [to-visit <all-squares>] # could optimise this to all potential winning squares
  (if (seq to-visit)
    (let [square (first to-visit)
          symbol (symbol-of square)
          r (take-while #(= % symbol) (right-of square))
          b (take-while #(= % symbol) (below-of square))
          d (take-while #(= % symbol) (diagonal-of square))]
          (if (= (max (map count [r b d])) 3)
            true
            (recur (remove-from to-visit [sq r b d))))))
